# Personal Portfolio - Deployment Guide

## 🚀 Build Status: ✅ READY FOR DEPLOYMENT

Your personal portfolio has been successfully built and is ready for deployment!

## 📊 Build Summary

- **Status**: ✅ Build successful
- **Static Pages**: 5 (/, /blog, /lab, /contact, /_not-found)
- **Dynamic Pages**: 1 (/blog/[slug])
- **Performance**: Optimized with compression and static generation
- **WASM**: `/lab`'s C++ numerics are compiled to `public/wasm/numerics.wasm` and committed to
  git — `npm run build` does NOT need Emscripten installed. Only changing anything under `cpp/`
  does (`npm run build:wasm`; see `scripts/build-wasm.sh`).
